# Telco Customer Churn Prediction
This project analyzes customer behavior to predict churn for a telecommunications company.
We use model prediction, SMOTE, random forest, logistic regression, and interpret results using LIME for explainability.

## Files
- `Customer_Churn_Prediction_using_ML.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing all data processing, exploratory analysis, modeling, and predictions.
- `Telco_Customer_Churn_.csv`: CSV file containing all the data for the processsing, analysis, modeling, and prediction for the code above.

## How to Run
1. **Downloading Files:**
- First, you want to download the `ipynb` file and the `csv` file.
- Second, you want to open google colab and open the downloaded `ipynb` file.
- Third, you want to drag the `csv` file into the side folder menu to have the file loaded into the system.
- Lastly, you want to run all the code which in turn should show the results.
